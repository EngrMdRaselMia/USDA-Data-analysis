# USDA-Data-analysis

### Steps for the Power BI Project

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered data on six agricultural products: Cheese, Milk, Egg, Honey, Yogurt, and Coffee.
   - The data included production volumes across different states in the USA, likely sourced from government or agricultural industry databases.
   - Collected data was organized into tables with relevant fields, such as product type, state, production quantity, year, and other possible factors like farm size or production method.

2. **Data Cleaning (in Excel):**
   - Opened the raw data files in Excel and cleaned the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Removed any duplicate rows, irrelevant columns, and inconsistent entries.
   - Managed missing data by filling gaps with averages or removing incomplete rows where necessary.
   - Standardized the data formats, ensuring consistency in values such as production numbers and state names, and ensured all date fields were in a uniform format.
   
3. **Data Modeling (in Power BI):**
   - Imported the cleaned data from Excel into Power BI.
   - Created a data model by connecting nine different tables, ensuring relationships were correctly established between tables based on common keys, such as state, product ID, or year.
   - Ensured the integrity of the relationships (one-to-many or many-to-many) to enable proper data analysis.

4. **Data Analysis:**
   - Leveraged Power BI's DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated fields and measures, such as total production per state, average production per product, or growth trends over time.
   - Explored different perspectives of the data, analyzing the production of each product across states, identifying states with the highest production, and observing trends over time for each product.

5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Used Power BI's visualization tools to create dynamic and interactive charts, maps, and graphs:
     - Line charts to show trends in product production over time.
     - Bar or column charts to compare production between different states or products.
     - Geographical maps to visually represent production by state, highlighting high-production regions.
   - Added filters and slicers to allow dynamic interaction with the data, enabling users to filter by product, state, or year.
   - Applied titles, legends, and data labels to make the visualizations clear and informative.

6. **Interpretation of Results:**
   - Analyzed the visualizations to draw conclusions, such as identifying which states lead in the production of specific products (e.g., California for Milk or Wisconsin for Cheese).
   - Examined trends in production growth or decline, and explored possible factors contributing to these changes.
   - Developed insights that could inform decision-making, such as production efficiency improvements or identifying markets with growth potential.

These steps outline the complete process from data collection, cleaning, modeling, to analysis and visualization in Power BI for the agriculture production project.
